            <h3>Story Overview</h3>
            <p>
                In "LAkhe," you find yourself trapped in a haunted house, where your only goal is to escape.The house is Nepali themed  and is filled with eerie sounds, dark corridors, and the constant presence of a ghostly figure known as "Lakhe." Navigate through the house, solve puzzles, and avoid getting caught by Boxi to make your way out alive.

            <h3>Game Mechanics</h3>
            <p>
                Similar to the Escape game, "LAkhe" involves stealth, strategy, and quick reflexes. You must explore different rooms, find hidden keys, and use various tools to unlock doors and progress through the game. Be quiet and careful, as making too much noise can attract Bhoot, who will chase you down if you're not cautious.
            </p>
            <h3>Game Design Details</h3>
